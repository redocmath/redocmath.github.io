  <h1>Tournament Of Towns 2023 2024</h1>

  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Here are my approaches to <em>Tournament of Towns 2023/2024</em> (Fall 2023, Senior A-level.) I’ve heard a lot about <em>Tournament of Towns</em>, but this is my first try to solve problems in <em>Tournament of Towns</em>. I recorded time taken to solve each problem, to express how that problem was difficult for me.</p>

<p>Check out the problems at <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c3683569_20232024_tournament_of_towns">here</a>!</p>

<h2 id="problem-1-5">Problem 1 (≤5’)</h2>
<p>After I read this problem, I was almost sure that the answer must be <em>equal</em>. In detail, I believed there must be a way to <em>pair</em> two roots completely. Fortunately, it was not so hard to find the way.</p>

<p>Let 
\[
p_{(a_0, a_1, …, a_{45})}(x) = \sum_{0\leq i\leq45} a_i x^i
\]
and
\[
X_{(a_0, a_1, …, a_{45})} = \lbrace x~\vert~ p_{(a_0, a_1, …, a_45)}(x)=0 \rbrace
\]
where \(a_i \in \left\{1,2,...,46\right\}\). Then, we can easily show 
\[
\forall x\in X_{(a_0, a_1, …, a_{45})}\quad x&lt;0.
\]
Also, it is trivial that
\[
\left\lbrace\frac1x \vert x \in X_{(a_0, a_1, …, a_{45})}\right\rbrace = X_{(a_{45}, a_{44}, …, a_0)}.
\]
Because \(\left\lbrace x+1, \frac1x+1 \right\rbrace = \left\lbrace positive, negative \right\rbrace\) for \(x&lt;0\),</p>

<p>\[
\left\vert\left\lbrace x \vert x\in X_{A} \cup X_{A^{-1}} \wedge x+1&gt;0\right\rbrace\right\vert = 
\left\vert\left\lbrace x \vert x\in X_{A} \cup X_{A^{-1}} \wedge x+1&lt;0\right\rbrace\right\vert
\]</p>

<p>where \(A=(a_0, a_1, ..., a_{45})\) and \(A^{-1}=(a_{45}, a_{44}, ..., a_0)\). Obviously for every \(A\) we can find \(A^{-1}\neq A\), the answer must be <em>equal</em>.</p>

<h2 id="problem-2-20">Problem 2 (20’)</h2>
<p>I tried to solve smaller problem first, so I generalized the numeral system and observed \(N\) from unary to ternary by hand. Let \(N(d)\) be \(N\) for \(d\)-base numeral system.</p>

<p>\[
{\lbrace N(d)\rbrace}_{d=1}^3 = \lbrace1,3,7\rbrace = \lbrace2^1-1, 2^2-1, 2^3-1\rbrace
\]</p>

<p>From observation, I guessed \(N(d)\) would be \(2^d-1\).</p>

<p><em>Proof.</em> \(N(1)=2^1-1\) (base condition). Let’s assume \(N(d)=2^d-1\) and show \(N(d+1)=2^{d+1}-1\) to apply mathematical induction. We can easily show \(N(d+1)\geq 2N(d)+1=2^{d+1}-1\) with a constructive solution:</p>

<p>\[
X(d+1) = X(d)\circ(d+1)\circ X(d)
\]</p>

<p>where \(X(d)\) is one of the possible number whose length is \(N(d)\) and \(\circ\) is concatenation. Now let’s show \(N(d+1)\leq 2N(d)+1\). Obviously</p>

<p>\[
\left\vert\left\lbrace X(d+1)_i \in \lbrace1,2,…,d\rbrace \right\rbrace\right\vert \leq N(d)
\]</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>\[
\left\vert\left\lbrace X(d+1)_i = (d+1) \right\rbrace\right\vert \leq N(d)+1
\]</p>

<p>because there must not be adjacent digits \((d+1)\). These two inequalities easily prove \(N(d+1)\leq 2N(d)+1\). Finally, \(N(d+1)=2N(d)+1 \Rightarrow N(d)=2^{d}-1\).</p>

<h2 id="problem-6">Problem 6</h2>

<h2 id="problem-7">Problem 7</h2>

<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>

<p>Since I was young, I have been afraid of geometry problems. And it has leaded me to avoid to solve geometry problems.</p>

<p><img src="https://images2.memedroid.com/images/UPLOADED27/51a6caa51e932.jpeg" alt="Geometry Meme" /></p>

<p>Recently, however, I realized my terrible geometrical skills and started to try more geometry problems rather than avoiding them. I feel proud of myself because I solved Problems 4 and 5 at this time, and this is why problem-solving is more meaningful for me—<strong>impressive and fun</strong>.</p>
