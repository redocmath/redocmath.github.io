  <h1>Daily Math: Iran Mo 2023 (1)</h1>

  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Here is my approach to problem 2 in <em>Iran MO 2023</em> (3rd Round.) Thanks to <em>Yejun Shin</em> for recommending a great problem set. I recorded time taken to solve each problem, to express how that problem was difficult for me.</p>

<p style="color: red">This is not a perfect solutions; it is my approach (brief solution), so there might be some logical loophole. Please let me know via comments :)</p>

<p>Check out the problems at <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c3509728_2023_iran_mo_3rd_round">here</a>!</p>

<h2 id="problem-2-15">Problem 2 (≤15’)</h2>
<p>Within seconds of reading the question, I became sure that the answer was <strong>NO</strong>. After a few tries, I figured out \(g(1)=f(1)=1\), and I could make a key proposition</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>\(g(n)\) must be \(g(n) = n\), which gives \(f(n)=2n-1\), a contradiction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was stucked on trying to prove this proposition for a while. After about ten minutes, I realized I was hanging around to prove even though I already had a key idea. <em>Yuck!</em></p>

<p><em>Proof</em>. \(g(1)=1\) (base condition). Assume that for \(1\leq k \leq n\) \(g(k)=k\). Then from \(ng(n)=(n-1)g(n-1)+f(n)\), \(g(n)&gt;\frac{(n-1)^2}{n}\). Because \(g\) is bijective, \(g(n)=n\).</p>

<p>Thus, the anser is <strong>NO</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>
<p>Today was so busy that I couldn’t solve more than one problem. Because all problems in this problem set look very good, I think I’ll continue to challenge this problem set.</p>
